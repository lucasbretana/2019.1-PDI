## Morphological Operations
- based on set theory

- developed for microscopic images

- morphological means the study of shapes or structure
  + area that deal with characteristics of the shapes in an image
  + used to remove unwanted imperfections

### Basics
- no texture, i.e., grey scale
  + the interest properties are shape, size and location

- connectivity

- an object is any group of connected pixels
- use concepts of side connectivity
       /\
-    < .. >   __4 connectivity__
       \/ 


      \/\/
-    < .. >   __8 connectivity__
      /\/\ 

#### Structural Element
- is a rectangular matrix of pixels that contains either 0 or 1
  + when both dimensions are odd then it has _true central pixel_
  + when one of the dimension is even the central pixel is the one above and/or on the left
